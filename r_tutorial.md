# R tutorial

## Installing R and getting started
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is free and I highly recommend using R through the IDE, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which offers a lot of helpful functionality like generating R markdown files easily and integrating with git.  A common confusion is updating RStudio is \emph{not} also updating R as they are separate programs.

Like Python, R requires installing libraries for more advanced tools, but unlike Python the installation is typically very easy.  Most libraries you will want to use are located in the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (Comprehensive R Archive Network), which can be accessed through R, directly.
